A straightforward platformer game incorporating enemies, collectibles, and doors locked behind logic gate puzzles.

The game is a 2D side scrolling platformer action-adventure game with Metroidvania elements interwoven into its core gameplay. 
The game follows the story of a nameless protagonist, who is made out to be a secret agent for an organization tasked with escaping from a heavily armed facility after a mission went bad. 
The facility is being patrolled by tough security robots, and most of the facility is on lockdown. The player has to find a way to deal with the enemy robots and persevere through all of the security mechanisms that the facility has to offer.
